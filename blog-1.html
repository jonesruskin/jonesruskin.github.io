            <h1>Kitchen Triangle</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-body">
            <p>Unlike olden days where usually the homes are much larger & spacious in India, nowadays due to unstable economic conditions and the rising cost of construction and land value the houses are much smaller, especially in cities. This forces not only architects & engineers but also the house owners to take part in planning their long dreamed house and to make use of the available space more efficiently without affecting the desired aesthetics. While planning one of the most difficult part in getting yourself satisfied is the kitchen part, where all the cooking, roasting & boastings happen, yup, it’s “The Kitchen”. Planning kitchen is of such importance that even, some contractors focus precisely on designing kitchen in order to impress the queen of the house. If the contractors get succeeded with it then the queen makes sure that the payments are made on time and makes the further proceedings smoother.</p>
            <p>Although planning kitchen is not that complex, having numerous discussions with unprofessional and other closed circles (by this time it’s very common that you remember your uncle from other professions or at least a long term family friend of yours) most thrive to make it harder. While some make the process look complex by have confusing conversations, some search and scan several dozen kitchen plans online in order to make it much order. Remember! the more number of choices you have, the more difficult it becomes while choosing & the more chances that you blabber at night without proper sleep.</p>
            <p>Planning doesn’t have to be that difficult. If you fall under any of the above mentioned categories, then simply make sure that you get the triangle right, “The Kitchen Triangle”. Although there are many architectural theories revolving around kitchen planning, the kitchen triangle concept seems to have withstood the test of time, and is still in use, widely.</p>
            <p>Basically the three work areas must be close enough so that the cook doesn’t have to walk more steps and get fried up during cooking. But it must also be kept in mind that these elements must not be so close so that even when two people work there must not be any collisions or disturbances.</p>
            <p>The kitchen triangle also known as the “the work triangle”, also known as the “the golden triangle” is a concept according to which the major work areas of the kitchen should be arranged in such a way that they form an triangle. According to this -almost a century old concept, the major work areas of the kitchen are – the Cooking area, the Sink area & the refrigerator area, which is (true). Let’s consider these work areas as points (corners of triangle) and imagine a line connecting these points to form a triangle then, according to this concept,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The overall length (sum of all 3 sides) of this imaginary triangle should not be less than 13 feet and not more than 26 feet.</li>
                <li>The distance between these the 3 major work areas (cooking top, sink & refrigerator) should be between 4 to 9 feet.</li>
                <li>Islands, tables, cabinets and other obstacles must not cut the kitchen triangle by more than 12 inches (1 feet).</li>
                <li>Walls, tall cabinets, cupboards and other obstacles must not be present in between any two points (work areas) of the imaginary triangle.</li>
                <li>No major traffic flow must pass through the kitchen triangle.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Remember, following kitchen triangle is neither law nor rule. It is just a concept or theory which we could rely on to plan kitchen effectively. It is actually implemented for small houses having smaller kitchens.</p>
            <p>As we could understand, the basic concept of the kitchen triangle is to make kitchen friendlier to use while reducing the traffic flow through the kitchen. Unlike other rooms of the house, Kitchens are usually planned and designed in such a way that they are not completely closed. Usually kept open and connected with either hall or hallway, kitchen is not only used for the purpose of cooking but also to eat, work and even for entertainment sometimes.</p>
            <h2>Shapes</h2>
            <p>While the most preferred pattern for Kitchen triangle concept is a U-shaped kitchen, other customized layouts can also be planned according to your desire, without affecting the basic rules of the kitchen triangle theory. While opting to a galley kitchen violates the traffic flow rule of the triangle concept, a galley kitchen which is closed at one end retains the core concept of the triangular placement of the 3 basic elements.</p>
            <p>Incase if you want to make your kitchen look bigger and modern, then you can opt to open-kitchen concept, but make sure you have an island at one side, to retain the core principles of triangular placement of the elements of the work triangle concept.</p>
            <p>After u-shaped kitchen, L-shaped kitchen is much preferable while you are betting on the kitchen triangle concept, as it is very easy to place the elements in the triangular pattern easily.</p>
            <h2>The Benefits</h2>
            <p>Having the three most important elements of the kitchen (cook, sink, and refrigerator) within few steps makes the life of cook much easier than ever before. While opting to Kitchen triangle concept has numerous advantages, one of the major advantage is that it provides enough counter space around sink and other appliances, especially around cooking and storing appliances. If you have ever been in a kitchen where the refrigerator is placed against the cooking area, you know how badly the counter space (separating the two) is needed. Other than the perspective of productivity & convenience, it is very important not to have any obstacles like islands, cabinets, etc., blocking the cook’s path between the 3 major elements.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <p>Being almost a century old, the kitchen triangle concept was based on the assumptions that also dates back almost a century ago. We demand & expect more out of the kitchen, today.</p>
            <p>In foreign countries, back in those days, kitchens were just a place for housewives for preparing meals. It is true, that the kitchen triangle concept is of great advantage, but only if the kitchen was to be used by a single cook at a time. However, if the kitchen has to be utilized more than one cook then the kitchen triangle concept may not work well as the space required will be more, basic.</p>
            <p>In today’s world, kitchen is also used as a space for informal, friendly gatherings with friends and family members. Hence some people prefer larger kitchens and in those cases opting to kitchen triangle is impossible.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Although the kitchen triangle is more simple and straight forward, there are conspiracies that the kitchen triangle concept is expired or should be expired.</p>
            <p>In case of rich modern large homes, where there are more than one cook, the modern designers do not design kitchens with kitchen triangle concept, but have opted to work zone approach. Unlike olden days, kitchens have much broader range of functions such as dinning, regular gatherings, work & even entertainment. This is the main reason why kitchen triangle has been mistreated now.</p>
            <p>Today, our kitchens are large, and in many families there are more than one cook. Moreover, our kitchens today have a broader range of functions than just cooking. They’re also where we dine, entertain, and work.  Therefore, modern kitchen designers do not design kitchens exclusively around the work triangle approach, but have adopted a work zone approach.</p>
            <p>Whatever concept you choose to work with make sure that you plan it well in advance and make firm decisions while planning for your long dreamed home! </p>
            <p>Hope this is helpful</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading & sharing!!!</p>
